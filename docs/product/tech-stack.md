# Tech Stack

## Frontend

N/A for v0.0.1 (CLI + services only). Post-v0.0.1 charter: platform-native
toolkit FFI bindings, a portable UI layer written in the language itself,
and a Qt/GTK FFI bridge. Web target (JS/HTML/CSS) parked.

## Backend

Stage-0 bootstrap: `bootstrap/stage0/oxl.c`, a checked-in C snapshot
of the driver emitted by `bootstrap/cmd/codegen`, compiled through
the system `cc` (`LANG_CC`/`LANG_LDFLAGS`/`LANG_SQLITE_SRC` knobs).
The product toolchain is `cmd/oxl`, itself `.oxl` end to end; the
`bootstrap/` components self-compile and run correctly
— lexer/parser/check/codegen all four emit identical output under
self-compilation. "Self-hosted" describes the chain state.
Runtime: C-compatible (`runtime/rt.c`), arena-based, no tracing GC.
LLVM remains a possible future backend once codegen size justifies it.

## Database

N/A for the language itself. The pilot CRUD app uses SQLite via C FFI
(libsqlite3).

## Other

- C FFI as the interop boundary, from day one
- LSP server inside the single toolchain binary
- ox-agent for work items, staged skills, and pipelines (`.ox-agent/`);
  project docs under `docs/`
- Execution model: single driver + parallel agent worktrees
